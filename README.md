# Collision Risk for Whales in the New York Bight
## Mapping ship-whale collision risk using Python
This Jupyter Notebook was developed as part of a collaborative university assignment investigating collision risk between shipping activity and whale presence in the New York Bight.
The project applies spatial analysis techniques using Python libraries such as GeoPandas, rasterio, and matplotlib to identify areas of overlap between ship traffic and whale sightings. The goal was to assess spatial collision risk and visualize high-risk zones using point, raster, and polygon data.
